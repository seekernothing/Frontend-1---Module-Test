Project Overview (100 Marks)


Task
Create a responsive HTML and CSS design based on the provided Figma design, with hover animations and Inter font imported from Google Fonts.




Objective
By completing this task, students will demonstrate their ability to create a responsive design using HTML and CSS, with attention to detail in terms of font size, padding, and other elements. They will also practice using hover animations and importing fonts from Google Fonts.




Instructions:
Download the images and icons from the provided Figma design.
Create an HTML file with appropriate tags and structure for the design.
Use CSS to style the HTML elements to match the design in Figma, paying careful attention to details such as font size, padding, underline, etc.




Import the `**Inter**` font from Google Fonts and use it for all text in the design.
Use media queries to make the design responsive for laptops, tablets, and mobiles.
Refer to the hover animations provided in the link and add them to the appropriate elements in the design.
Test the design on different devices to ensure that it is fully responsive.




Add Hover Animation to the button: The animation for the button will involve a scale and color change effect when it's hovered over. The button will grow slightly larger and the background color will change to a lighter shade.
Submit the completed project with a well-organized file structure, including all HTML, CSS, and image files.
